**TL;DR**

Peer-run behavioral health organizations offer holistic assistance for mental health illnesses and substance use disorders through peer supporters, who help service users obtain recovery and wellness resources. Unfortunately, staffing and expertise limitations significantly hinder the operations of behavioral health organizations, making it hard to match all service user needs. 

We address this issue through **Peer Copilot**, a language model-powered assistant that helps peer supporters discover resources, navigate government benefit programs, and construct goals for service users.Because information reliability is critical for peer supporters, we designed Peer Copilot to rely on verified information sources and avoid hallucinations.  

Empirically, we conducted human evaluations with 14 peer supporters and 6 service users and found that both groups overwhelmingly supported using Peer Copilot in practice. Peer Copilot is now used by a group of peer supporters in a large behavioral health organization, and we are actively expanding the use of Peer Copilot.
