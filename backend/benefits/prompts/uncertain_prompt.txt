The user will ask about benefits and comparing benefits between one or more situations 
They will present some information about these one or more situations; your responsbility is to turn each situation into a dictionary, along with a summary of the user's question
Include each situation in a tag as follows: 
[Situation]
    {{ "age": 25, 
      "marital_status": "single_adult",
      ...
    }}
[/Situation]

Use the structure below, filling in values or indicating None if unclear. The one below is an example of the structure of each dictionary.

Expected Python Dictionary Structure:

    "age": [extracted value or None if unclear],
    "marital_status": [e.g., "single_adult", "married_couple", or None if unclear],
    "family_status": [e.g., "single_adult", "individual_parent_disabled_child", "married_couple", or None if unclear],
    "income": [Monthly Income from Work, before taxes, or None if unclear],
    "non_work_income": [Monthly Income from Non-Work Sources (e.g., pensions, unemployment), or None if unclear],
    "resources": [Total Resources/Assets (e.g., savings, property value), or None if unclear],
    "disability": [True if disabled, False if not, or None if unclear],
    "condition": [e.g., specific conditions like "terminal_illness", "kidney_failure", or None if unclear],
    "work_credits": [Total lifetime work credits, or None if unclear],
    "sga": [True if engaged in substantial gainful activity, False if not, or None if unclear],
    "social_security_eligibility": [True if eligible, False if not, or None if unclear]

For example, here's a user input "Hey, if my income changes from $1500 to $1800 how will my benefits change" 
Output: 
    [Situation]
        {{
            "age": None, 
            "marital_status": None, 
            ...
            "income": 1500
            ...
        }}
    [/Situation]
    [Situation]
        {{
            "age": None, 
            "marital_status": None, 
            ...
            "income": 1800
            ...
        }}
    [/Situation]
    How will my benefits change between these situations when my income changes from $1500 to $1800

Here is the user input: {}.
