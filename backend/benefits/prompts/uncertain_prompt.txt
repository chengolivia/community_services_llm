Extract the relevant personal information from the following user input and present it in a structured dictionary format.This extracted information will be used to determine eligibility for government benefits. Here is the user input: {}. Use the structure below, filling in values or indicating None if unclear. Present the final result as a Python dictionary.
Sometimes, the client will ask for two scenarios (for example; "I am 25 years old and single. I make $1800 per month. What happens if I make $200 more per month?"). In that situation, return a list of dictionaries, with one dictionary for each situation. 

Expected Python Dictionary Structure:

    "age": [extracted value or None if unclear],
    "marital_status": [e.g., "single_adult", "married_couple", or None if unclear],
    "family_status": [e.g., "single_adult", "individual_parent_disabled_child", "married_couple", or None if unclear],
    "income": [Monthly Income from Work, before taxes, or None if unclear],
    "non_work_income": [Monthly Income from Non-Work Sources (e.g., pensions, unemployment), or None if unclear],
    "resources": [Total Resources/Assets (e.g., savings, property value), or None if unclear],
    "disability": [True if disabled, False if not, or None if unclear],
    "condition": [e.g., specific conditions like "terminal_illness", "kidney_failure", or None if unclear],
    "work_credits": [Total lifetime work credits, or None if unclear],
    "sga": [True if engaged in substantial gainful activity, False if not, or None if unclear],
    "social_security_eligibility": [True if eligible, False if not, or None if unclear]

Make sure that your output is a python dictionary, not a string.
