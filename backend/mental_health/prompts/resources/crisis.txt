1. Crisis as an Opportunity for Growth and Change by Shery Mead
This article challenges traditional views of mental health crises, advocating for a shift in perspective. Mead critiques the medicalized view that sees crises as something to be fixed or avoided. Instead, she presents crisis as an opportunity for personal growth and self-discovery, emphasizing the importance of peer support in fostering healing. Key points from the text include:

Building Mutual Relationships: Peer support should be grounded in reciprocal relationships where both individuals learn from each other.
Being with “Big” Feelings: Acknowledging and accepting intense emotions without trying to suppress or label them as harmful.
Challenging the Current Story: Through mutual trust, individuals can reframe their own experiences and re-interpret the meanings they’ve assigned to their feelings and actions.
Creating a New Shared Story: By sharing vulnerabilities and challenging old assumptions, peer relationships allow individuals to grow, change, and redefine their crises.
2. Mapping Our Madness by Momo
This workbook is designed as a practical guide for individuals navigating mental health crises or extreme states. Momo offers tools to help people plan ahead for potential emotional upheavals. It encourages individuals to reflect on their triggers, needs, and coping strategies in order to feel more empowered during challenging times. The workbook also focuses on:

Self-Care: Encouraging daily rituals and preparations for emotional well-being.
Recognizing Crisis Signals: Helping individuals identify the early signs of crisis or extreme states to manage them more effectively.
Creating a Support System: Lists of people, places, and resources that can help during crises.
Embracing Personal Agency: The workbook frames mental health not as a condition to be fixed, but as a complex and valid experience to be understood on one's own terms, without judgment.
3. The Warm Line Experience by Chaya Grossberg
This piece explores the Warm Line service, a peer-run alternative to crisis hotlines. Unlike traditional crisis lines, where there may be a push for intervention or hospitalization, warm lines focus solely on offering compassionate, non-judgmental listening. Grossberg’s experience highlights:

Peer Support: Warm lines are run by individuals who have lived through their own mental health struggles, making them more empathetic and relatable.
Non-Intrusive Support: There’s no agenda to diagnose or solve problems—just an open space for people to talk and feel heard.
The Value of Being Heard: The call gave Grossberg a sense of relief and relaxation, highlighting the profound benefit of simply being listened to without pressure.
Each of these works highlights the importance of peer support, self-reflection, and reframing experiences in a way that validates individual experiences and promotes healing without relying solely on conventional medical models. Together, they suggest a holistic and empowering approach to mental health, grounded in empathy and shared understanding.

Hotlines That Avoid Police

These hotlines and warmlines can provide alternatives to police intervention and avoid using police in most cases. It’s always good to ask all hotlines and warmlines about their policies before disclosing information that could lead to an involuntary intervention or forced hospitalization. Some utilize other first responders, such as mobile crisis units with mental health professionals, who are mandated reporters and can administer psychiatric assessments that may trigger forced hospitalization.
