      "2. **Exercise Goal**: \n",
      "   - **Specific**: The client will engage in a moderate-intensity exercise (like walking or chair exercises) for at least 30 minutes, four times a week.\n",
      "   - **Measurable**: Use a log to record the type of exercise and duration on each day.\n",
      "   - **Achievable**: Given the client's age and physical capacity, this is a feasible goal with proper support.\n",
      "   - **Relevant**: This goal directly relates to his aim of maintaining physical wellness.\n",
      "   - **Time-bound**: The client will commit to this exercise plan for the next six weeks.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Social Connection Goal**: \n",
      "   - **Specific**: The client will participate in at least one community social activity or group event each week, such as a senior center gathering, a local club, or an online group.\n",
      "   - **Measurable**: Keep a record of the events attended each week for accountability.\n",
      "   - **Achievable**: Given his desire to build social connections, this is an attainable goal with encouragement and support.\n",
      "   - **Relevant**: This goal addresses his feelings of isolation and supports his overall emotional wellness.\n",

      "\n",
      "2. **Exploring Barriers**: \"Can you share some challenges you face when it comes to cooking or exercising regularly? What do you think might prevent you from sticking to these new habits?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Social Connections**: \"What kind of social activities do you enjoy or think you would enjoy participating in? Have you had any experiences with local groups or community events that stood out to you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Support Needs**: \"How can I, or someone else, best support you in achieving these goals? Are there specific types of assistance or encouragement you feel would be most helpful?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Reflecting on Progress**: \"As you work on these goals, how do you envision measuring your progress? What would make you feel proud of your achievements along the way?\" \n",
