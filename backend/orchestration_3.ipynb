In addition, consider financial security, particularly in relation to potential disability benefits and housing support. • Characteristics and Considerations: SMART goals should be tailored to measurable outcomes that consider her physical limitations, part-time employment framework, and the necessity for consistent well-being. Goals should be realistic, time-bound, and flexible enough to adjust to her ongoing physical and situational challenges. They must integrate metrics that monitor progress in health, employment, and social recovery while being achievable within her current support system.\n",

      "**Resources Module**:\n",
      "• Types/Categories of Resources: Identify resources focused on physical rehabilitation or adaptive services for disabilities, employment support services, local community services for housing subsidies, and mental health support networks. Also consider legal or advocacy support linked to immigration documentation issues. • Criteria/Conditions for Searching Resources: Resources should be located within or near Paterson, NJ, and tailored to individuals with partial disabilities. They must be accessible to someone balancing part-time work commitments, with clear eligibility requirements related to income, disability status, and immigration documentation. Emphasize up-to-date information on eligibility, community partnerships, and comprehensive support services.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Follow-up Questions Module**:\n",
      "• Insightful Follow-up Topics: Questions should explore the specifics of her daily challenges—both in managing physical wellness and work demands—as well as her current coping mechanisms and support networks. Additional insights into her long-term aspirations for stable employment and financial independence, as well as her social support system, would open avenues for further guidance. • Themes/Areas for Clarification: Clarify the nuances of her disability and how it affects her work, inquire about her current level of social engagement and mental health status, and delve into her past experiences with housing or disability support. Also, investigate how her immigration status might intersect with available benefits, which will allow for a clearer picture of her eligibility and resource needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Benefits Eligibility Module**:\n",
      "• Types of Benefits/Eligibility Considerations: Conceptually review potential disability benefits, housing subsidies, and other public assistance or social support programs that accommodate individuals with physical disabilities working part-time. Recognize that benefits might span from healthcare services to vocational rehabilitation programs. • Contextual Clues/Criterial Guidance: Look for evidence of how her disability impacts her ability to work full-time, her income level relative to local cost-of-living metrics, and her current status within temporary housing. Her documented immigration status is also crucial, as many benefits programs have citizenship or residency conditions. Ensure that the criteria used reflect both her physical limitations and her financial or housing instability over time, thereby establishing a clear link between need and eligibility. This conceptual guidance should enable each module to structure its reasoning in a way that addresses the multiple layers of the user’s situation, ensuring a holistic and sensitive approach to her challenges.\n",
