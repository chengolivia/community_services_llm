### Scoring and Eligibility Categories

For each benefit:
1. Calculate an eligibility score based on the sum of weights for met criteria divided by the total possible weight:
   - Assign the full weight if a criterion is met.
   - Assign half the weight if data for a criterion is missing.
   - Assign zero if a criterion is not met.

2. Use the following thresholds to categorize eligibility:
   - **Highly Likely Eligible**: Score ≥ 90%
   - **Likely Eligible**: Score between 70% and 89%
   - **Maybe Eligible**: Score between 40% and 69%
   - **Not Eligible**: Score below 40%

### Expected Output
For each benefit, return the output in a structured natural language format, detailing:
   - **Eligibility Category**: (e.g., 100% eligible, Likely eligible, Maybe eligible, or Not eligible)
   - **Score**: The eligibility score as a percentage.
   - **Explanation**: List of met, unmet, and missing constraints for each benefit.

### Example Output Format:

Benefit: SSI  
- Eligibility Category: Likely eligible  
- Score: 75.00%  
- Met Constraints: [list of met constraints]  
- Unmet Constraints: [list of unmet constraints]  
- Missing Constraints: [list of missing constraints]

Please assess the user’s eligibility based on `extracted_info` and provide a detailed output for each benefit.
