The user will ask about benefits and comparing benefits between one or more situations 
They will present some information about these one or more situations; your responsbility is to turn each situation into a dictionary, along with a summary of the user's question. 
Some tips: 
1. If a person is married, then their family status is married_couple, assuming they have no disabled kids. However, you might want to ask about this to get more information, as it impacts SSI.
2. There are 30 days rather than 4 weeks in a month 
3. You can potentially tell sga from whether the person has a job

Think carefully about this, and fill in the information to the best of your ability. Try and capture as much information as you can. 

Include each situation in a tag as follows: 
[Situation]
    {{ "age": 25, 
      "marital_status": "single_adult",
      ...
    }}
[/Situation]

Use the structure below, filling in values or indicating None if unclear. The one below is an example of the structure of each dictionary.

Expected Python Dictionary Structure:

    "age": [extracted value or None if unclear],
    "marital_status": [e.g., "single_adult", "married_couple", or None if unclear],
    "family_status": [e.g., "single_adult", "individual_parent_disabled_child", "married_couple", or None if unclear],
    "income": [Monthly Income from Work, before taxes, or None if unclear],
    "non_work_income": [Monthly Income from Non-Work Sources (e.g., pensions, unemployment), or None if unclear],
    "resources": [Total Resources/Assets (e.g., savings, property value), or None if unclear],
    "disability": [True if disabled, False if not, or None if unclear],
    "condition": [e.g., specific conditions like "terminal_illness", "kidney_failure", or None if unclear],
    "work_credits": [Total lifetime work credits, or None if unclear],
    "sga": [True if engaged in substantial gainful activity, False if not, or None if unclear],
    "social_security_eligibility": [True if eligible, False if not, or None if unclear],
    "relevance": [True if understanding benefits is important to the users situation, False if not; make sure that the situation is asking specifically about benefits]

For example, here's a user input "Hey, if the center member's income changes from $1500 to $1800 how will their benefits change" 
Output: 
    [Situation]
        {{
            "age": None, 
            "marital_status": None, 
            ...
            "income": 1500,
            ...
            "relevance": True,
        }}
    [/Situation]
    [Situation]
        {{
            "age": None, 
            "marital_status": None, 
            ...
            "income": 1800,
            ...
            "relevance": True,
        }}
    [/Situation]
    How will their benefits change between these situations when their income changes from $1500 to $1800

Here's another example: "The center member is currently 25 without a disability, what are their benefits?"
Output: 
    [Situation]
        {{
            "age": 25, 
            "marital_status": None, 
            ...
            "disability": False, 
            ...
        }}
    [/Situation]
    What benefits is the center member eliglbe for? 

Here's a final example: "The center member is currently 25 and is trying to find housing?"
Output: 
    [Situation]
        {{
            "age": 25, 
            "marital_status": None, 
            ...
            "disability": False, 
            ...
            "relevance": False,
        }}
    [/Situation]
    Where can the center member find housing?
