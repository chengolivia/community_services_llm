Human trafficking and trauma informed responses
Definition & Importance:
Trauma-informed care (TIC) is a service delivery approach that acknowledges the profound impact of trauma, emphasizing physical, psychological, and emotional safety for patients and providers. It aims to prevent retraumatization while fostering control and empowerment. It is particularly important for patients who have experienced adverse childhood experiences or trauma such as human trafficking.
Key Concepts in Trauma-Informed Care
Trauma-Informed Care vs. Trauma-Specific Interventions:
Trauma-Informed Care: A universal approach treating everyone as if they may have experienced trauma, focusing on communication, language, and empowering actions.
Trauma-Specific Interventions: Tailored treatments for individuals with known trauma histories.
The Four R's of a Trauma-Informed Approach:
Realizing: Understand the prevalence of trauma and pathways for recovery.
Recognizing: Identify how trauma impacts individuals, including staff.
Responding: Integrate trauma knowledge into all practices and policies.
Resisting: Actively work to avoid retraumatization.
Six Key Principles of Trauma-Informed Care:
Safety: Ensure physical and emotional safety by maximizing patient control.
Trustworthiness & Transparency: Build trust through clear communication and addressing limits (e.g., confidentiality).
Peer Support: Encourage mutual self-help among trauma survivors.
Collaboration & Mutuality: Level power imbalances and involve all stakeholders.
Empowerment, Voice, & Choice: Foster self-advocacy and self-empowerment.
Cultural, Historical, & Gender Issues: Address systemic inequities and historical trauma affecting marginalized groups.
Common Causes of Re-Traumatization:
Mislabeling trauma symptoms as personality or mental disorders.
Overly authoritative or confrontational interactions.
Challenging or dismissing reports of trauma.
Ignoring the influence of a person’s traumatic history.
Shift in Perspective:
Trauma-informed care encourages changing the response from:
“What’s wrong with you?” to “What happened to you?”
Trauma-Informed Care (TIC): Key Actions for Providers
Realize: Understand the widespread impact of trauma.
Recognize: Identify how trauma manifests in individuals, families, staff, and systems.
Respond: Integrate trauma knowledge into policies, procedures, and practices.
Resist: Actively avoid actions that may retraumatize survivors.
Core Practices:

Build trust and understanding with survivors by avoiding actions resembling past trauma (e.g., authoritarian behaviors).
Empower survivors by prioritizing their voice and choice in decision-making.
Organizational Responsibilities
Organizations supporting survivors (e.g., housing, advocacy, case management):

Should ground practices in trauma-centered principles.
Must offer voluntary, survivor-driven services to ensure dignity and agency.
Should aim to minimize trauma triggers and increase trust between survivors and staff.
Policies and procedures must align with a survivor’s right to self-determination, acknowledging their history, culture, and preferences.
Toolkit Goals:

Equip organizations with actionable steps, creative ideas, and research-backed guidelines to evaluate and improve trauma-informed policies.
Six Key Principles of Trauma-Informed Care (CDC and SAMHSA)
Safety: Ensure physical and emotional safety defined by the survivor's perspective.
Trustworthiness and Transparency: Build trust through open communication and decisions.
Peer Support: Promote mutual self-help and recovery through peer relationships.
Collaboration and Mutuality: Share power and decision-making across all organizational levels.
Empowerment, Voice, and Choice: Foster resilience and agency for survivors and staff.
Cultural, Historical, and Gender Issues: Address biases, historical trauma, and systemic inequities while ensuring cultural responsiveness.
Housing First Approach
Prioritize stable, permanent housing as the foundation for survivors to rebuild their lives. This model aligns with trauma-informed care by emphasizing safety, stability, and survivor autonomy.

Core Principles:

Homelessness is a housing issue and should be treated as such.
Housing is a fundamental right.
Survivors should have access to permanent housing as quickly as possible.
Issues contributing to homelessness are best addressed after housing is secured.
Key Features of Housing First:

No requirements for sobriety, income, or program participation before accessing housing.
Survivors retain agency in service plans, which are harm-reduction focused.
Eviction into homelessness is actively avoided; survivors are offered transfers if needed.
Checklist for Trauma-Informed Housing Programs
Access is not contingent on sobriety, income, or past criminal record.
Accommodations for disabilities and compliance with ADA standards.
Culturally appropriate and language-accessible services.
Survivor-driven goals and plans.
Non-judgmental communication and harm-reduction practices.
No mandatory service participation as a condition for housing.
Prioritize community building and problem-solving over rigid therapeutic goals.
By centering survivor agency and avoiding retraumatization, trauma-informed care and Housing First principles create an environment conducive to healing and long-term stability.

Core Principles of Trauma-Informed Care
Empowerment through Understanding:
Providers should:
Realize the widespread impact of trauma.
Recognize how trauma manifests in individuals, families, and systems.
Integrate trauma knowledge into policies, procedures, and practices.
Actively resist re-traumatization.
Survivor-Centered Approach:
Prioritize survivors' rights, needs, and preferences.
Acknowledge their history, culture, language, and experiences.
Avoid actions that mimic the perpetrator's power dynamics.
Trust and Engagement:
Building trust fosters emotional and physical healing.
Voluntary engagement in services supports long-term success.
Key Principles of Trauma-Informed Organizations
Safety: Physical and interpersonal safety is a priority.
Trustworthiness and Transparency: Operations build and maintain trust through openness.
Peer Support: Encourages mutual support and recovery.
Collaboration and Mutuality: Shared decision-making and leveled power dynamics.
Empowerment, Voice, and Choice: Promotes resilience and self-determination.
Cultural, Historical, and Gender Sensitivity: Acknowledges and addresses cultural and historical trauma.
Housing First Approach
Focus: Secure stable housing quickly, prioritizing it as a basic human right.
Principles:
Treat homelessness as a housing problem.
Eliminate traditional barriers like sobriety or minimum income.
Address issues contributing to homelessness after housing stability.
Checklist for Housing First Programs:

Access not contingent on sobriety, income, or criminal history.
Reasonable accommodations for disabilities and cultural needs.
Survivor-driven housing and service goals.
Harm-reduction philosophy supports non-judgmental communication.
Eviction into homelessness is avoided whenever possible.
Strategies for Policy Development and Intake Procedures
Policy Development:
Identify barriers to accessing housing (e.g., preconditions, strict rules).
Focus on trauma-informed practices that build relationships and avoid punitive measures.
Regularly obtain feedback from survivors for policy improvement.
Trauma-Informed Intake Practices:
Simplify initial intake to focus only on essential information.
Be transparent about procedures, mandatory reporting, and confidentiality.
Avoid overwhelming survivors with extensive paperwork or invasive questions.
Provide information in the survivor's preferred language.
Avoid requiring survivors to retell their trauma story during intake.
Introduce a collaborative and supportive process (e.g., pre-filled forms, offering breaks).
Framework for Intake Communication:

Say it: Verbally provide essential information.
Share it: Offer printed materials for reference.
Sign it: Clearly explain forms that require signatures, ensuring understanding.
Practical Applications for Survivors
Voluntary Engagement: Survivors choose which services to participate in, fostering agency.
Non-Punitive Policies: Avoid creating environments of power and control (e.g., strict curfews, confiscating personal items).
Conflict Resolution: Provide multiple, survivor-centered options.
Culturally Sensitive Practices: Tailor policies to the cultural and linguistic needs of survivors.
Training and Staff Development:

Focus on relationship-building over rule enforcement.
Equip staff with skills to navigate boundaries and practice self-care.

Key Terminology and Concepts
Physical vs. Emotional Safety:
Physical Safety: Being unharmed with no immediate threats.
Emotional Safety: Feeling secure, which may be affected by trauma and individual perceptions.
Safety is relative, shaped by individual experiences and trauma, making discussions complex.
Harm Reduction vs. Safety Planning:
Harm Reduction: Helps survivors minimize unsafe behaviors, focusing on their definition of safety rather than the provider’s.
Safety Planning: Centers on creating strategies to achieve “safer” conditions rather than absolute safety.
Common Pitfalls in Survivor-Centered Practices
Limiting Self-Determination:
Happens when providers impose their definitions of safety on survivors.
Avoid by trusting survivors as experts of their own safety, maintaining ethical boundaries, and considering harm reduction models.
Requiring Law Enforcement Involvement:
This can undermine trust and autonomy.
Avoid mandating or implying the necessity of police reports unless legally required. Provide survivors with options and let them define justice.
Restrictive Rules (e.g., confiscating phones or curfews):
These mimic trafficker control and can harm survivors' autonomy.
Avoid such restrictions unless absolutely necessary, as survivors may need access to communication for work, family, or support.
Shifting the Safety Paradigm
Adopt a harm reduction mindset, recognizing that survivors often use effective strategies to stay safe.
Safety plans should:
Begin with survivors' current strategies and knowledge.
Focus on minimizing risks while respecting survivors’ agency.
Providers should avoid overstepping professional boundaries, as ultimate responsibility for actions lies with survivors.
Harm Reduction and Substance Use
Trauma often correlates with substance use.
Nonjudgmental communication and education on safer practices are vital.
Substance use alone should not justify eviction in Housing First programs.
Case Study: Organization QRS
QRS adapted their approach to support LH, a survivor with frequent overdoses, while maintaining safety for staff and others.
They collaborated with LH to identify safer practices, including a location closer to medical services, instead of cutting off access.
The strategy upheld harm reduction principles with minimal restrictions.
1. Survivor-Centered and Voluntary Service Models
Core Principles: Focus on justice, access, and survivor autonomy by empowering survivors rather than enforcing disempowering rules.
Challenges: Power dynamics between staff and survivors can impede trust and progress.
Solutions:
Openly discuss systemic barriers with survivors.
Implement survivor-centered policies emphasizing relationship-building over control.
Case Study: Organization Flower

Challenges: Strict city housing laws and ineligibility criteria created barriers for survivors.
Actions: Staff:
Acknowledged systemic issues openly with survivors.
Tailored solutions to survivors' unique situations.

2. Survivor Engagement Principles
Survivors must be engaged intentionally and meaningfully, recognizing their expertise beyond lived experiences.
Key Practices:
Build safe relationships to understand survivors' preferences for involvement.
Actively incorporate survivor feedback into organizational policies and programs.
Compensate survivors fairly for their contributions as consultants or partners.
Case Study: Organization JKL

Shifted away from a “group home mentality” to a trauma-informed Housing First model.
Residents contributed to policy revisions, intake forms, and safety protocols.
Resulted in reduced triggers, better communication, and a sense of shared ownership.
3. Language Access
Legal Compliance: Organizations receiving federal funds must ensure LEP survivors have meaningful access to services, in accordance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act and Executive Order 13166.
Best Practices:
Allocate resources for professional language assistance services.
Avoid reliance on survivors' family or friends for interpretation.
Provide all vital information in the survivor's preferred language.
4. Cultural Humility
Moves beyond "cultural competency" by focusing on systemic barriers and power dynamics.
Encourages providers to challenge biases and structural inequalities through personal accountability and institutional change.
Case Study: Organization XYZ

Designed a culturally sensitive space for Latino male trafficking survivors by considering language, food, and culturally relevant services.
Reflected on barriers specific to male-identifying survivors to foster inclusivity.
Key Recommendations
Person-Centered Services: Engage survivors through intentional partnerships and respect their expertise, compensating them for their input.
Transparent Communication: Discuss systemic barriers honestly and collaborate on survivor-led solutions.
Cultural Humility: Adopt practices that challenge systemic inequalities and address implicit biases.
Language Accessibility: Develop comprehensive policies ensuring timely, effective, and accurate language support services.
