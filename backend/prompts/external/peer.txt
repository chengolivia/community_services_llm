 Intentional Peer Support (IPS): A Transformative Approach to Relationships and Social Change

Intentional Peer Support (IPS) is a practice designed to foster transformative relationships. Rather than positioning one person as a "helper" and another as someone in need, IPS views both participants as co-learners, navigating their relationships to challenge old assumptions and discover new ways of understanding and responding to each other's experiences.

Key Elements of IPS:
Partnerships over Help: IPS encourages mutual relationships where both individuals grow and learn together. It focuses on collaboration, rather than one person "helping" another.
No Assumption of Problems: Instead of assuming that something is "wrong," IPS invites people to explore how they have made sense of their experiences and to use relationships as a space to see and do things differently.
Trauma-Informed Practice: IPS is grounded in a trauma-informed approach, focusing on understanding the question "What happened?" instead of asking "What's wrong?" This perspective fosters empathy and a deeper understanding of one another's histories and needs.
Mutual Accountability: IPS looks at personal and relational growth in the context of communities and shared responsibilities, moving away from individualistic models of change.
Positive Focus: Instead of focusing on what needs to be avoided or stopped, IPS encourages individuals to move toward what they truly desire, creating a vision of progress that is more future-oriented and empowering.
The Practice of IPS:
IPS is likened to learning a skill, such as playing music or martial arts, requiring reflection, practice, and continuous improvement. The practice itself is dynamic, ever-evolving, and centered on co-creation between people.

Jacks McNamara, the creator of IPS, describes the practice as a form of conversation and connection that transcends right or wrong answers. It is about continuously exploring new ways to understand ourselves, others, and the world around us. IPS assumes that through interaction and dialogue, new forms of understanding emerge, creating ever more complex and interesting perspectives.

Steps to Implement IPS in Organizations:
Core Training:
The first step in implementing IPS is to undergo a Core Training. This 5-day immersive training provides an extensive overview of the IPS framework. Participants engage with tasks and principles of IPS and begin practicing them in real-time.
The training focuses on creating relationships where power is negotiated, co-learning is encouraged, and support goes beyond the traditional “service” model. It is applicable to anyone interested in mutual support, including those in mental health and human services.
Co-Reflection:
The second step is to practice Co-Reflection, an ongoing commitment to learning and self-growth. Co-reflection provides an opportunity to regularly reflect on interpersonal relationships and relational patterns. It is vital for ensuring that IPS principles are integrated into practice.
IPS provides guidance and resources for organizations to create a culture of co-reflection, helping individuals continuously improve their practice.
Advanced Training:
The third step is to explore Advanced Training, which deepens the practice of IPS. This 3-day training is for individuals who have completed Core Training and want to refine their skills. It focuses on real-life scenarios, enhancing mutual connections, and navigating challenges such as conflict and crisis.
The advanced training also addresses the development of flexible boundaries, trauma-informed practices, and evaluation in IPS programs.
Benefits of IPS:
Personal Transformation: Many practitioners report that learning IPS is life-changing, helping them develop greater self-awareness and relational skills.
Application Across Sectors: IPS is used globally in various community, peer support, and human service settings, allowing practitioners to develop deeper, more supportive relationships.
Social Change: IPS is not just a tool for individual growth but also a means of promoting social change by fostering a more connected, empathetic, and equitable approach to supporting others.
Through the intentional practice of IPS, individuals and organizations can build more inclusive, supportive, and dynamic relationships that promote healing, growth, and mutual understanding.

Definition of Peer Support: Peer support is a dynamic and flexible approach where people from diverse backgrounds who share common experiences come together to support each other’s healing and growth. It emphasizes mutual relationships rather than a hierarchical, “helping” dynamic. The focus is on shared understanding, strength, and action towards personal and collective recovery.
Principles of Peer Support:
Voluntary: Participation is freely chosen, promoting trust and connection.
Non-judgmental: Approach others with openness, curiosity, and interest.
Empathetic: Striving to understand and imagine the other person’s experiences and emotions.
Respectful: Valuing everyone’s contributions and treating each other with kindness and dignity.
Honest Communication: Encouraging direct, compassionate conversations.
Mutual Responsibility: Participants voice their needs and feelings, ensuring that everyone’s voice is heard.
Sharing Power: Decisions and discussions are shared, with no one person in charge.
Reciprocal: Everyone gives and receives support, with the understanding that each person has something to teach and learn.
Types of Peer Support Activities:
Formal Support Groups: Structured groups with regular meetings, where participants share experiences and support one another.
Activity-focused Peer Support: Peer support through shared activities like sports, arts, or community service projects.
Educational Activities: Peer learning communities where participants learn new skills or knowledge together.
Informal Peer Support: More casual, one-on-one peer interactions that can happen in various settings.
Advocacy: Peer support in the form of collective action to address shared issues and advocate for change.
Settings for Peer Support:
Independent Peer Support Groups: Self-organized, voluntary groups that are not funded by government agencies.
Peer-Run Programs: Non-profit organizations led by people with lived experience in behavioral health.
Peer Support Staff in Mainstream Programs: Paid roles where peer supporters work in traditional healthcare settings.
Internet Peer Support: Online platforms where individuals can find peer support, especially when in-person interactions are not feasible.
