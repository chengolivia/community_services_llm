Here's a resource on transgender people; please use this whenever responding to questions about transgender people


Cultural Humility: Healthcare providers should recognize the diversity of transgender experiences and avoid preconceptions. Treat each patient as an individual, respect their preferences for terminology, and avoid making judgments or unsolicited comments about their appearance. Providers should not expect patients to "teach" them but instead should focus on relevant questions for the visit.
Staff Training: All clinic staff, including front desk, nursing, and lab staff, should receive training on transgender health issues as part of their onboarding process.
Waiting Areas: Display transgender-themed materials (posters, artwork, pamphlets, etc.) in waiting areas to show commitment to serving the transgender community.
Bathroom Policies: Make at least one gender-neutral bathroom available. If not, allow patients to choose either the women's or men's room based on their preference.
Fluency of Terminology: Providers should familiarize themselves with the terminology used by the transgender community, which may vary by region or individual. Cultural humility should guide the use of terms.
Gender Identity Data Collection: Collect gender identity data (chosen name, pronouns, gender identity, and sex on the original birth certificate) to ensure proper tracking and patient satisfaction. The "two-step" method is recommended: ask for gender identity and sex assigned at birth. This ensures better identification of transgender individuals and avoids invisibility.
EMR (Electronic Medical Record) Recommendations:
EMRs should include functionality for chosen names and pronouns, and display these throughout the system.
Keep transgender status private unless the individual has legally updated their documents.
Store specific transgender-related health data (e.g., hormone use, organ inventories) in the appropriate medical history sections.
EMRs should be designed to respect privacy while ensuring accurate data collection for patient care and policy-making.
Terminology for Gender Identity Data:
The two-step approach for gender identity data collection:
Gender Identity: Male, Female, Transgender man/woman, Genderqueer/nonconforming, or Other (with an option to decline to state).
Sex Assigned at Birth: Male, Female, or Decline to state.

Physical Examination: The examination should be relevant to the patient's anatomy and specific to the reason for the visit. Providers should avoid making assumptions based on gender presentation and focus on the individual’s anatomy. It is important to consider the potential impact of prior negative healthcare experiences, including discrimination and abuse.
Gender-Affirming Approach:
Providers should use gender-affirming practices, which include using the patient’s correct name and pronouns throughout the visit.
Use general body part terminology or ask patients about their preferred terms.
Only examine body parts relevant to the visit (e.g., do not examine genitalia for an upper respiratory infection).
Secondary Sex Characteristics: Transgender patients may have secondary sex characteristics that reflect hormone therapy. These characteristics vary based on the duration of hormone therapy and age of initiation:
Transgender men: facial/body hair, clitoromegaly, increased muscle mass, acne, etc.
Transgender women: breast development, feminine fat redistribution, reduced muscle mass, soft skin, and reduced facial/body hair.
Vaginal Exam for Transgender Women:
The neovagina in transgender women differs from a natal vagina (lacks a cervix and fornices). Using an anoscope may be more appropriate for visual examination.
Sensitivity is key to ensure comfort, and providers should use appropriate methods based on individual anatomy.
Pelvic Exam for Transgender Men:
Pelvic exams may be traumatic for transgender men and trans-masculine individuals, and they are often not up-to-date on cervical cancer screenings.
The sample for a Pap smear should be labeled clearly to avoid confusion with an anal Pap.
Discuss the procedure with the patient beforehand, and allow them to have a support person or use strategies (e.g., music, distraction).
Offer the option of self-collection for some tests to reduce the need for a speculum exam.
Use calming techniques, such as explaining each step clearly and allowing the patient to stop the exam at any time.
Binding and Tucking:
Chest binding (for trans men) can lead to skin issues, and patients may be reluctant to remove binders. Providers should discuss safe binding practices.
Tucking (for trans women) may cause complications like hernias or skin breakdown, and sensitive history-taking and education are needed.
Intersex Conditions: If findings suggest intersex conditions, further evaluation should be done appropriately.

Medically Necessary Interventions:
The World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) defines various gender-affirming interventions, such as hormone therapy, surgery, facial hair removal, speech modifications, and behavioral adaptations, as medically necessary for transgender individuals.
Psychosocial Benefits:
Studies, though sometimes lower in quality, indicate improvements in psychosocial well-being after gender-affirming treatments like hormones or surgery. These improvements can include reduced anxiety, depression, and better overall quality of life.
Sevelius’ Model of Gender Affirmation:
This model suggests that denying access to gender-affirming treatments is associated with high-risk behaviors and increased rates of HIV infection. Conversely, providing access to such treatments reduces these risks and supports better health outcomes.
Personalized Treatment Pathways:
The current standard of care for transgender individuals is to allow each person to pursue only those interventions they desire to affirm their gender identity. This approach contrasts with past practices where individuals were required to follow a set path (psychological assessment → hormones → surgery).
Medical Interventions:
Hormone therapy is the primary medical intervention sought by transgender individuals, helping them develop secondary sex characteristics that align with their gender identity.
Surgical Interventions: There is a broad range of gender-affirming surgeries, which can be categorized as:
Specific to transgender individuals:
Feminizing vaginoplasty
Masculinizing phalloplasty / scrotoplasty
Metoidioplasty (clitoral release/enlargement, possibly with urethral lengthening)
Masculinizing chest surgery (top surgery)
Facial feminization procedures
Reduction thyrochondroplasty (tracheal cartilage shave)
Voice surgery
Common surgeries (not specific to transgender populations):
Augmentation mammoplasty
Hysterectomy / oophorectomy
Orchiectomy
Vaginectomy

Terminology and Pronouns
Gender Nonbinary (GNB) Identities: GNB individuals do not fit within the traditional binary gender framework. They may identify as a mix of male and female, neither, or outside of the gender spectrum. Terms like "gender fluid," "pangender," "neutrois," "androgyne," or "masculine/feminine of center" are used.
Pronouns: GNB individuals may use gender-neutral pronouns such as "they/them," "zie/hir," "xe/xem," or "ze/hir." It’s crucial to use the chosen name and pronouns correctly, and providers should ask for clarification if unsure. For example:
"They/Them/Theirs"
"Ze/Zir/Zirs"
"Xe/Xem/Xyr"
"Per/Per/Pers"
Transition Approaches
Hormone Therapy:
Nonbinary people may choose hormone therapy based on their desired secondary sex characteristics, with lower doses or limited periods of use.
For the feminine spectrum, androgen blockers or low-dose estrogen might be used.
For the masculine spectrum, low-dose testosterone may be acceptable, and adjustments like increasing testosterone to stop menses may be considered if needed.
Other approaches (e.g., contraception like medroxyprogesterone) can also be used.
Reproductive and Fertility Considerations: Providers must address fertility concerns as part of informed consent and recognize that some combinations of physical changes may not be possible (e.g., deepened voice without facial hair).
Surgical Options:
Nonbinary individuals may opt for surgeries that align with their gender identity, such as chest reconstruction or breast augmentation.
Feminine Spectrum: Some may desire vaginoplasty but not breast development, and if gonadectomy occurs, hormone replacement is needed.
Masculine Spectrum: Options like metoidioplasty (keeping the vagina) are available, as well as other surgeries depending on personal desires.
Other Nonbinary Considerations
Legal and Medical Documentation: One challenge for GNB individuals is the lack of nonbinary gender markers in medical and legal documents (e.g., IDs, passports). Advocacy groups are working to introduce nonbinary gender categories into legal, medical, and educational systems.
Non-Medical Expressions: Packing, tucking, and binding are essential methods of expression for some GNB individuals, and some may express both masculine and feminine traits simultaneously.
Key Recommendations for Providers
Be aware of the evolving terminology and pronouns associated with GNB identities.
Use an individualized approach to transition care, respecting the unique needs and desires of each GNB person.
Ensure informed consent, including discussions about reproductive and fertility issues, and clarify expected outcomes of treatments.
Address the lack of nonbinary gender markers in documentation and support advocacy efforts to expand recognition.

HIV Screening for Transgender Individuals
Universal Screening: Like the general population, transgender individuals should be screened for HIV at least once. After initial screening, repeat testing should be based on a risk assessment, which includes an accurate sexual history that reflects anatomical and sexual behavior.
Transgender Women: Must be asked about both insertive and receptive intercourse if they have a penis.
Transgender Men: Those with a vagina should be asked about both vaginal and anal intercourse. The risk of HIV through receptive vaginal sex in those with vaginoplasty is not yet fully understood.
Accurate and open-ended questions are essential to assess risk effectively.
HIV Prevention
Condoms: Remain a primary prevention method. However, condom use may be challenging for transgender women, particularly those on feminizing hormones, due to reduced tumescence. Condoms may also be difficult for transgender men with phalloplasty, depending on their specific surgical approach.
Biomedical Interventions:
Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP): Effective in preventing HIV when used as prescribed, particularly for transgender women. There are no known drug-drug interactions between PrEP and gender-affirming hormones, but the effectiveness of PrEP relies on consistent use.
Non-Occupational Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (nPEP): Similar to non-transgender individuals, nPEP should be administered following potential HIV exposure. Social marketing should be tailored to the transgender population.
Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) and Hormone Therapy
ART and Hormone Therapy Co-Administration: HIV treatment does not contraindicate hormone therapy. In fact, hormone therapy may improve engagement in HIV care. Transgender women on ART and feminizing hormones (e.g., estrogen) may need dose adjustments, particularly with medications that affect the cytochrome P450 enzyme system. Most ART regimens are safe with estrogen except for some protease inhibitors (e.g., amprenavir).
Monitoring Hormonal Efficacy: In transgender women, there may be concerns about the interaction between ART and estrogen. It’s essential to monitor estradiol levels and adjust ART regimens if needed to ensure effective care.
Masculinizing Hormones: There are no documented interactions between ART and testosterone or anti-androgens (e.g., spironolactone) used for masculinization.
Opportunistic Infections and Prophylaxis
HIV-related Opportunistic Infections: Transgender individuals with HIV may require prophylaxis for opportunistic infections like PCP pneumonia. Drugs like Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) may interact with spironolactone, leading to dangerous conditions like hyperkalemia. Close monitoring of serum electrolytes and renal function is advised when these medications are co-administered.
Key Recommendations
HIV care for transgender individuals must be individualized, considering the unique challenges they face, such as discrimination, trauma, and structural inequities.
It is essential to use trans-inclusive approaches in HIV prevention strategies (e.g., PrEP) and to address potential concerns regarding drug interactions between ART and gender-affirming hormones.
Health care providers should ensure that transgender patients are fully informed about their treatment options and are given the support they need to engage in ongoing HIV care.

Legal Sex and Gender Identity Documentation
The concept of "legal sex" is complex and varies significantly across jurisdictions. In some countries, such as Argentina, Denmark, Malta, and Ireland, the legal recognition of gender identity is based on self-determination, allowing individuals to change their legal sex without requiring health professional certification or medical treatment. However, most countries, including the United States, require some involvement of health professionals to facilitate a legal change of sex, if this change is permitted at all.

U.S. Legal Framework
Under U.S. federal law, and in certain states, surgery is not required to change legal sex. Instead, a health professional must certify that their patient has undergone "necessary" medical or psychological treatment for transition. This treatment, however, is not universally defined, as there is no one-size-fits-all approach for all transgender individuals. Some transgender people may not undergo surgery or hormone therapy, yet their legal sex can still be changed. Legal documentation that aligns with one's gender identity plays a critical role in improving a transgender person's quality of life by ensuring safer travel, access to employment, and facilitating medical care.

Surgical Requirements for Legal Sex Change
In certain jurisdictions, there may be a requirement for surgery in order to change legal sex. However, it’s important to note that no specific surgery is required for all transgender people. The health professional completing this documentation should be aware of this nuance and understand that there is no universal "necessary" medical treatment for all transgender individuals.

Changing Legal Documents
Transgender individuals may experience challenges in reconciling their legal sex with their sex-specific medical care, such as screenings for cervical cancer or prostate disease. In cases where there is a conflict between legal and biological sex in medical records, healthcare providers may need to contact insurance companies to explain the specific circumstances to prevent denial of coverage. After legally changing their gender markers, individuals should update their name and sex with their insurance company and medical provider to ensure that their medical and legal records are consistent.

Legal Name Changes
In many jurisdictions, changing a legal name is not inherently a gendered process, and the name change process for transgender people is typically identical to that for non-transgender people. However, this can vary depending on local regulations.

Resources for Document Changes
U.S. Department of State guidelines for passports
U.S. Social Security Administration guidelines
The National Center for Transgender Equality provides state-specific guidelines for changing identification documents in the U.S.
In Europe, Transgender Europe (TGEU) offers resources and guidelines for changing gender identity documents.
Conclusion
The legal and administrative processes surrounding the recognition of gender identity can be challenging for transgender people, with significant variations in requirements depending on the jurisdiction. However, advancements are being made in several parts of the world to simplify the procedures for legal gender change, supporting transgender individuals in aligning their legal and lived identities.

Autonomy in Sex-Segregated Systems and Gender Identity
A fundamental principle in sex-segregated systems is granting individuals the autonomy to use facilities and participate in programs that align with their gender identity. This includes access to restrooms, inpatient and residential beds, locker rooms, and other gender-segregated spaces. When non-gendered facilities are available and preferred, individuals should have the option to use them, but access to services should not be contingent upon the availability of such facilities. This approach ensures that transgender individuals are treated with dignity and respect while preserving their rights to access spaces and programs based on their lived experiences.

Legal Protections and Expanding Rights
In the United States, the legal framework supporting access to facilities and programs based on gender identity has evolved, with recent state and federal regulations advancing transgender rights:

State Laws: In states like California, there are explicit protections that allow students to use facilities and participate in programs according to their gender identity. California law requires that students be allowed to choose the facilities that align with their gender identity, or to use a private facility if preferred. Additionally, students should be referred to by their preferred name and pronouns, and their gender identity should be accurately reflected in data systems.
Title IX and Department of Education: The U.S. Department of Education, under Title IX, has reinforced that students must be allowed to use programs and facilities consistent with their gender identity, further cementing the legal right to non-discriminatory access.
Department of Health and Human Services (HHS): HHS regulations now require shelters and housing programs to provide accommodations based on gender identity. This includes ensuring that transgender individuals have access to housing and services that reflect their gender identity, addressing critical needs in institutional and temporary housing settings.
WPATH Standards of Care (SOC) and Institutional Environments
The World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH), in its Standards of Care (SOC) Version 7, emphasizes the importance of providing comprehensive and respectful care to transgender individuals in institutional settings. The SOC recognizes the need to ensure that all aspects of transition-related care are accessible to those living in institutions, and highlights that the practice of sex segregation based solely on external genitalia may not be appropriate. This practice could place transgender individuals at heightened risk for victimization and emotional harm. Therefore, institutional environments should adapt policies and practices that prioritize the safety, dignity, and autonomy of transgender people, allowing them to live and receive care in alignment with their gender identity.

Conclusion
The expansion of legal rights for transgender individuals regarding access to facilities and programs according to gender identity is a positive development toward ensuring equality and reducing discrimination. Policies at the state and federal levels, supported by evolving healthcare standards such as those provided by WPATH, promote the dignity and rights of transgender people in sex-segregated systems. These legal protections not only provide greater autonomy but also reduce the risks of victimization and trauma in institutional and public settings.

Homelessness and Discrimination Among Transgender Individuals
The experience of homelessness among transgender individuals is a significant issue. According to the National Transgender Discrimination Survey, one-fifth of transgender people reported experiencing homelessness, often due to intolerant family members, discrimination in the workplace, or an inability to find or maintain employment due to discrimination and disability. The circumstances surrounding homelessness can have long-term effects on mental and physical health. Furthermore, many transgender people seeking shelter face harassment, denial of service, or even sexual assault by shelter staff or other residents. The survey revealed that 55% of transgender individuals attempting to access a homeless shelter were harassed, 29% were turned away, and 22% experienced sexual assault in these settings.

Barriers in Accessing Healthcare and Services
Transgender individuals often face discrimination in healthcare and social service settings, particularly from providers who may not be adequately educated on transgender issues. This lack of knowledge can exacerbate existing challenges and result in individuals not receiving the necessary support. To address this gap, the National Healthcare for the Homeless Clinicians Network has provided high-quality training for healthcare providers to improve their understanding of transgender issues, helping them offer better care to homeless transgender individuals.

Discrimination and Assault in Shelters
Homeless shelters are common settings where transgender people experience discrimination and assault. Federal laws prohibit discrimination in public settings, including shelters, yet many transgender people are still unable to express their gender identity due to widespread stigma and harassment. Best practices for addressing this include the collection of gender identity data in a non-discriminatory, confidential manner and offering individuals the choice of housing options, considering both their gender identity and safety concerns. Ideally, most transgender individuals prefer to be housed according to their gender identity, but some may prefer housing based on their assigned sex at birth for safety reasons.

Functional Disabilities and Mental Health Challenges
Transgender individuals who experience homelessness often face additional challenges, including functional disabilities, mental health issues, and chronic physical conditions. Many transgender people are unable to work due to disabilities, such as those stemming from gender dysphoria, depression, anxiety, or PTSD from past traumas. Physical assaults and substance abuse may result in chronic conditions, further limiting employment opportunities. The lack of education and job prospects can hinder their ability to learn new skills, perpetuating a cycle of poverty and homelessness. In some cases, transgender individuals may be eligible for Social Security Disability benefits, which can be an essential resource for those seeking to escape homelessness.

Gender-Affirming Care for Homeless Transgender Individuals
Hormone therapy and gender-affirming surgeries are considered medically necessary for treating gender dysphoria. However, homelessness has sometimes been used as a blanket exclusion for accessing these services, which is not warranted. Despite the hardships of homelessness, many individuals remain highly motivated to adhere to hormone therapy and continue their medical care. Healthcare providers for the homeless have had success in supporting transgender individuals in hormone therapy, and homelessness is not a contraindication for gender-affirming surgeries.

For surgeries such as chest, breast, or genital procedures, the stability of housing can influence the success of the procedure and recovery. The waiting period between referral and surgery often provides an opportunity to work on stabilizing housing. For some individuals, the prospect of surgery can serve as a strong motivator, offering hope during an otherwise hopeless time. However, it's crucial to manage expectations about the complexity of surgery, recovery, and aftercare, particularly when considering housing instability. Care teams should ensure that this process does not feel punitive or discriminatory but instead part of a supportive plan to help individuals achieve stability and successful outcomes.

Prevention and Support
Preventing homelessness among transgender individuals involves reducing discrimination in key areas such as family relationships, employment, and social interactions. Providing transgender individuals with equal opportunities and access to resources is vital. For those unable to work, securing disability entitlements can offer a critical pathway out of homelessness. Additionally, by implementing best practices in homeless shelters and educating service providers, the harms associated with homelessness can be mitigated. While significant research has already been conducted, further studies are needed to develop more effective strategies and policies to support transgender individuals in homeless situations.

Conclusion
Homelessness remains a significant and often life-threatening issue for many transgender individuals, with multiple intersecting factors such as discrimination, mental health issues, and lack of access to gender-affirming care. Comprehensive approaches that include educating service providers, offering access to healthcare, and preventing discrimination are essential in improving the lives of homeless transgender individuals. Furthermore, ongoing research and policy development are critical to creating a more supportive and inclusive environment for transgender people experiencing homelessness.
