I have some external resources for the following topics: 
1. Crisis-related response
2. Human trafficking and trauma informed responses
3. Trans-affirming care guidance 
4. Peer support (intentional peer support, trauma informed peer support)
Please let me know which are useful for the user; format your answer as only a json, like the following: 
{
    "crisis": true, 
    "human_resource": false, 
    "trans": false,  
    "peer": true, 
}
