      "   - **Reason for Choice:** This hotline specializes in crisis intervention and support for individuals experiencing distress, including suicidal thoughts. Given James's increased anxiety and alcohol use stemming from work-related trauma, this hotline can provide immediate support and connect him with professional help.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Narcotics Anonymous**\n",
      "   - **Phone Number:** 1-888-912-0401 (if he is looking for additional support for alcohol use)\n",
      "   - **Reason for Choice:** While Narcotics Anonymous primarily focuses on narcotic addiction, they also address issues related to substance abuse and can be a supportive group for someone like James who is experiencing increased alcohol use. They can provide him with resources and a community of individuals who understand addiction issues.\n",

      "3. **211 Code Blue Alert - NJ Warming Centers**\n",

      "   - **Reason for Choice:** Although this hotline primarily deals with homelessness and emergency services, they can provide resources and connect individuals in crisis to various local services, including mental health support and shelters if needed. This could serve as a supplementary resource for James to find additional help tailored to his situation.\n",
