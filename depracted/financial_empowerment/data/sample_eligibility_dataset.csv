Peer Specialist: ""Good afternoon! How can I help you today?""

Client: ""I’m 40 years old and have been working as a freelancer for the past few years. My income varies, but it’s usually around $2,500 a month. I don’t have any savings to speak of—maybe $300 in my account. My husband also works, and we manage our expenses together.""

Peer Specialist: ""It sounds like things are tight. Do you have any health issues that affect your ability to work?""

Client: ""Not exactly, but I’ve been dealing with chronic fatigue, and I’ve noticed it’s been harder to keep up with my work. I’ve been to doctors, but I haven’t received a clear diagnosis yet. I’m able to keep working, but it’s starting to wear me down.""

Peer Specialist: ""That must be frustrating. Have you applied for any benefits or thought about applying?""

Client: ""I haven’t. I wasn’t sure if I would even qualify for anything since I’m still working, and my condition isn’t officially diagnosed.""

Peer Specialist: ""That’s understandable. Let's look into your situation and see what might be available.""

Peer Specialist: ""Hello! I’m glad you reached out today. How can I assist you?""

Client: ""I’m 50 years old, and I’ve been struggling to make ends meet recently. I lost my full-time job a couple of years ago, and I’ve been working part-time ever since, earning about $1,500 a month. I don’t have much savings—around $700. My wife doesn’t work because of health issues, so it’s just me supporting the household.""

Peer Specialist: ""I understand. Do you have any health conditions affecting your ability to work?""

Client: ""Yes, I was diagnosed with severe arthritis a few years ago, and it’s been getting worse. Some days I can’t work at all because of the pain, but I try to keep going as much as I can.""

Peer Specialist: ""That sounds difficult. Have you looked into applying for any benefits?""

Client: ""I haven’t yet. I wasn’t sure if I would qualify for anything since I’m still working part-time, but we’re falling behind on bills and medical expenses, and I could use some help.""

Peer Specialist: ""That’s completely understandable. Let’s go over your situation and explore what benefits might be available for you.""

Peer Specialist: ""Hi! It’s great to meet you. What can I assist you with today?""

Client: ""I’m 45 years old and recently started working part-time after being laid off from my full-time job. I’m making about $1,200 a month right now. My savings are pretty low—around $600. I live with my partner, but they don’t work, so we rely on my income.""

Peer Specialist: ""That sounds stressful. Do you have any health concerns that are affecting your ability to work?""

Client: ""Yes, I was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis about five years ago, and it has been progressing. The condition makes it hard for me to keep a full-time job, and I’m struggling to cover my medical bills. My doctor recently recommended that I consider applying for benefits.""

Peer Specialist: ""I can understand how that would make things difficult. Have you applied for any benefits before?""

Client: ""No, I wasn’t sure what I’d be eligible for, especially since I’m still working part-time. But I definitely need help with medical costs and living expenses.""

Peer Specialist: ""That makes sense. Let’s take a closer look and see what benefits you might qualify for.""

Peer Specialist: ""Good afternoon! How can I help you today?""

Client: ""I’m 62 years old and recently retired after working for over 40 years in the construction industry. My pension gives me around $1,500 a month, and I’ve got about $1,000 in savings. My wife still works, but she’s planning to retire soon as well. I’ve been having issues with my back for a while now, which makes it hard for me to do much around the house.""

Peer Specialist: ""That sounds difficult. Have you applied for any benefits yet?""

Client: ""Not yet. I didn’t think I qualified for much since I have my pension, but I’ve been struggling with medical bills, and I’m not sure how long we can manage with just my pension and my wife’s income.""

Peer Specialist: ""I see. Let's go through your situation and explore what benefits you might be eligible for.""

Client: ""That would be great, I could really use the help.""
