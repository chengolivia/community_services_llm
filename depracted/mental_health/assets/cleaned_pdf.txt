- 1 - Wellness Wellness involves being aware of ourselves as whole people, including a sense of balance and contentment . It is the feeling that things are going well for us today, and can continue to go well for us tomorrow. It is the belief that we have meaningful relationships and a sense of meaning and purpose. Although we may have setbacks , or experience stress , we are resilien t and we have strength, material resources, and the support of others to survive and thrive. At the Institute , we believe that helping people improve their personal wellness , as they define it , is critical. Wellness incorporates all of the eight dimensions shown on the cover and back of this booklet . Each dimension of wellness can affect our overall quality of life , because wellness directly relates to how long we live (longevity) and how well we live ( quality of life). We find wellness i n the valued roles that we choose, such as friend, worker, volunteer, student , colleague, parent , spouse, and community member. These roles provide an identity, drive our daily activities, and ignite our passions. The eight -dimension model illustrates the idea that all eight dimensions are inter -connected. We all know how much they connect in our lives. When we feel financially stressed (e.g., increasing debt), we experience emotional stress ( anxiety), sometimes leading to physical problems ( illness ), less effectiveness at work (occupational), and may be even questioning our own meaning and purpose in life (spiritual). When we are not work ing (occupational), we lose some of our opportunities to interact with others (social), cannot get the quality foods and medical care we need to stay well (physical), and may need to move to a place that feels less safe and secure (environmental). Stress, addiction, trauma , disappointment , and loss can impact our wellness and the balance in our lives. Wellness requires that we balance work with play and rest , balance time out for recuperation and r ecovery with living our lives fully and productively , and balance the desire for rapid change with the known effectiveness of slow changes to build good habits. - 2 - Habits are key for wellness. Our habits affect what we do, how we feel, how we work, how we fuel our mind s and bodies , and how we spend or save money. Habits become ingrained . Some habits (excessive alcohol, harmful drugs or chemicals, consumption of energy drinks, sugar and fat laden foods) can have immediate or long term negative effects on physi cal, mental, and social well - being. We have to work consciously to maintain or establish good habits that contribute to our wellness , our valued roles, and our personal goals. Wellness involves a sense of empowerment. Each day we wake up we can make choic es. Empowerment goes hand -in-hand with taking personal responsibility for our day to day choices and our lives. Wellness and balance are defined by you, based on what you think is important and needed, as well as on your personal goals and values. We hope this guide will help you think about your own wellness – what you already do now (your daily routines, habits , and valued life roles and activities) , what else you can do or can learn to do , and what type of support s you need to focus on your wellness and balance. Many people find helpful is to look at their own wellness in each of the eight dimensions . This wellness booklet can offer some insights to determine things you are doing well and things you may want to start or stop doing. For each of the eig ht dimensions that follow, record your strengths and your thoughts about areas you may want to change or improve . Think about the actions you want to take and the supports that will help you take those actions . You can use our “Wellness Daily Plan,” f ound at the end of this booklet, to track your daily actions for improved wellness. If you need inspiration, the Plan also provides ideas for wellness activities in e ach domain. Although this booklet is designed to use by yourself , we hope you will consider sharing with co -workers , family, friends, or support group members , so you can review , plan, and grow together. We wish you a successful w ellness journey! - 3 - Wellness is not the absence of disease, illness, and stress but the presence1 of: • Purpose in life • Active involvement in satisfying work and play • Joyful relationships • A healthy body and living environment • Happiness Wellness is a conscious, deliberate process that requires being aware of and making choices for a more satisfying lifestyle .2 A wellness lifestyle includes a self- defined balance of health habits such as sleep and rest, eating well, productivity, participation in meaningful activity, a nd contact with support ers. 3 Wellness is multi- dimensional : physical, spiritual , social, emotional , intellectual, occupational, environmental, and financial
